Program 1: parenMatch.c 

Directions for Running this script

1) First go into the "stackADT.c" at lines 11 & 12 and ensure you comment out "#include "myDoubleType.h"

2) Go into the "doublyLinkedList.c" go to lines 84 & 85 and make sure you comment out the command "printf(%f\n, data)"

3) Enter the Linux Terminal and enter "gcc parenMatch.c stack.c doublyLinkedList.c"

4) Then enter into the terminal "./a.out in.txt out.txt"

Observe Results within the "out.txt" file to see the parenMatch program working

Program 2: postFix.c 

Directions for Running this script
